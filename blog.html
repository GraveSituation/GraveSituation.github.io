																					Pre 1935
						"Television came into being based on the inventions and discoveries of many men and scientists.  The 'first' generation of television sets were not entirely electronic.  The display (TV screen) had a small motor with a spinning disc and a neon lamp, which worked together to give a blurry reddish-orange picture about half the size of a business card!  The period before 1935 is called the "Mechanical Television Era".  This type of television is not compatible with today's fully-electronic television system."
</p>
<p> 																				1935-1941
				"During this period, 'electronic' television was perfected.  Several countries began broadcasting, most experimentally, with limited numbers of TV-sets in the hands of the public."
</p>
<p>
																					World War 2
														"World War-II halted nearly all television broadcasting worldwide."
</p>
<p>																				    1946-1949
									"The time period after World War-II is considered the last and final birth of television.  Families had accumulated savings during the war years, and were eager to purchase homes, cars and other luxuries denied them during the war.  Television sets were soon added to the 'must have' list.  The explosion of sets into the American marketplace occurred in 1948-1949.  The post-war sales boom for England followed a few years later."

</p>
<p>
																					1950-1959
									"1950-1959 was an exciting time period for television.  In the USA, B&W television exploded onto the scene at the beginning of the decade, mid-decade saw electronic color television and remote controls launched, and at the end of the decade the public witnessed some interesting styling changes and the introduction of transistorized television.  The toddler was becoming an adolescent."
